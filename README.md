### Welcome to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Andrew Marinelli** and I am a math/science teacher turned data science enthusiast! I graduated from the **Flatiron School Data Science Immersive** program in December 2021 and am excited to continue working on personal and professional projects here. 

I begin every project asking myself:
- **What story does the data tell?** 
- **Why does this story matter to my stakeholder?** 
- **How can I communicate its importance in a meaningful way?**

Data is more than just numbers and graphs - data tells a story and from this we can gain a wide variety of meaningful insights. I am dedicated to getting the most out of data by telling these stories.
